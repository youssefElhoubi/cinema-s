# CodeShögun Cinema Project

## Project Overview
This project is developed for **CodeShögun**, a startup where I play a dual role as a **designer** and **web developer**. The goal is to create a fully functional website for a cinema, starting with a **Figma** mockup of the homepage, and extending it to three additional pages: **Movies**, **Tarifs (Rates)**, and **Contact**. The entire project is managed using the **Scrum Framework** to ensure efficient task management and timely delivery.

## User Stories

### Designer Role:
- **Homepage**: Understand the Figma mockup of the homepage and ensure all designs are consistent with the style provided.
- **Movies Page**: Create an inspiring layout for the "Movies" page, showcasing available films.
- **Tarifs Page**: Design a clear and structured "Tarifs" page that displays pricing categories, including:
  - **Adulte**: Standard pricing for adults.
  - **Enfant**: Discounted pricing for children under 12.
  - **Étudiant**: Reduced pricing for students (upon presenting a valid student ID).
  - **Seniors**: Special rates for seniors over 65.
  - **Famille**: Special offers for families (e.g., 2 adults + 2 children).
  - Additional pricing categories as needed.
- **Contact Page**: Design a "Contact" page with a form that allows users to ask questions or provide suggestions.

### Developer Role:
- Convert the **Figma homepage mockup** into a functional webpage using **HTML** and **CSS**.
- Integrate the **Movies** page into the website based on the design mockup.
